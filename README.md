# Javaman
Our hero, JavaMan, roams the world in search of his princess Javette. He must avoid meeting ghosts who would also transform him into a ghost and must eat all the pastilles present on the tray to free Javette. The world is represented by a grid of boxes, therefore a 2-dimensional table, essentially for the representation of the walls; on the other hand the coordinates of the characters are continuous: JavaMan can be in coordinates (x, y), the lower rounding of x and of y . JavaMan and the ghosts can move either horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). At each turn of the game, they move according to their own speed. Javette, terrified, can not move. The game ends when JavaMan has eaten all of the pellets or when a ghost eats JavaMan.
